"""
P2 is a relaxation of P1 given that 
(i) the feasible solutions of P1 are a subset of the feasible solutions in P2,
    due to the fact that the constraints of the two problems are identical
(ii) the objective function P2 is less than or equal to the objective function of P1
    due to the fact that essentially the same objective function is used in both problems, but in P2 both sides of the objective function are multiplied by u_i

P5 is a relaxation of P6.
P6 is not a relaxation of P5.
