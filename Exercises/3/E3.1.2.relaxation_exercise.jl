P5 is a relaxation of P6 given that 
(i) the feasible solutions of P6 are a subset of the feasible solutions in P5,
    the constraints are similar in the two problems, with the difference being P5 having a larger right hand side for its constraint
    if you were to reformulate the constraints of P6 it would be
    x1 + x2 + x3 <= 3y which is strictly less than x1 + x2 + x3 <= 14y
(ii) the objective function P6 is less than or equal to the objective function of P5
    due to the fact that the objective functions are identical in P6 and P5

P5 is a relaxation of P6.
P6 is not a relaxation of P5.
